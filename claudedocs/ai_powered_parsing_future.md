## Current State of the Art (2025)

### Vision Language Models (VLMs)

**GPT-4 Vision & Claude 3 Opus** have transformed document understanding:
- Accept image + text inputs, output structured data
- Human-level performance on document extraction benchmarks
- Can handle spreadsheets, PDFs, invoices, tables with spatial understanding
- Support few-shot learning (learn from 3-5 examples)

**Key Capability**: Upload Excel screenshot → AI extracts table structure, understands headers, identifies data patterns.

### Active Learning & Few-Shot Learning

**Active Learning**: AI learns from minimal labeled examples
- User labels 5-10 rows from a file
- AI infers patterns and applies to remaining 1000s of rows
- Confidence scores show where AI is uncertain → human reviews only those

**Few-Shot Learning**: AI adapts with tiny datasets
- Show AI 3 examples: "This column → product_ean"
- AI generalizes pattern to entire file
- Works with 95%+ accuracy after 5-10 examples

### Existing Platforms (Competitors)

**Flatfile** ($35M Series A, 2024):
- Visual data onboarding with AI mapping suggestions
- Users drag-drop columns to match schema
- AI learns from corrections and suggests transformations
- **Limitation**: Requires predefined schemas, not truly adaptive

**Alteryx Designer Cloud** (formerly Trifacta):
- Visual data transformation with ML-suggested transformations
- Interactive data profiling shows data quality issues
- Pattern-based column transformation
- **Limitation**: Enterprise-focused, complex UI, expensive

**SuperAnnotate**:
- AI-powered data labeling with active learning
- Human-in-the-loop refinement
- Models generate first-pass labels, humans refine hard cases
- **Limitation**: Focused on ML training data, not business data transformation

## The Vision: AI-Powered TaskifAI

### User Experience Flow

**Step 1: Upload File (No Configuration)**
```
User: *uploads "acme_sales_Q1.xlsx"*
AI: "I detected a spreadsheet with 15 columns and 2,453 rows.
     I see columns that might be: Order Date, Product Code, Amount, Customer.
     Would you like me to suggest a mapping?"
```

**Step 2: Visual Labeling Interface**
```
[Interactive Spreadsheet View]

User highlights "Product Code" column → clicks "This is Product EAN"
User highlights "Amount" column → clicks "This is Sales EUR"
User highlights "Date" column → clicks "This is Order Date"

AI: "Got it! I'll map these patterns. Should I:
     - Convert USD to EUR using exchange rates?
     - Parse date format MM/DD/YYYY?
     - Validate EAN-13 format?"

User: *toggles options* → "Yes, Yes, No"

AI: "Processing 2,453 rows with your rules...
     ✅ 2,401 rows processed successfully
     ⚠️ 52 rows need review (uncertain dates)"
```

**Step 3: AI Learns for Next Upload**
```
User: *uploads "acme_sales_Q2.xlsx" (same vendor, different file)*

AI: "I recognize ACME format from your previous upload!
     Automatically applying:
     - Product Code → product_ean
     - Amount USD → sales_eur (converted)
     - Date format: MM/DD/YYYY

     Process automatically? [Yes] [Review First]"
```

## Technical Architecture

### Option 1: Vision LLM Approach (Cutting Edge)

**Components**:
1. **Claude 3 Opus / GPT-4 Vision** for document understanding
2. **Few-shot prompt engineering** for pattern learning
3. **Vector database** (Pinecone/Weaviate) for storing user examples
4. **React-based labeling UI** for user interaction

**Flow**:
```python
# 1. User uploads file
file_content = read_excel("acme_sales.xlsx")
screenshot = render_spreadsheet_screenshot(file_content)

# 2. AI analyzes structure
prompt = f"""
You are analyzing a sales spreadsheet. Identify:
- Column headers and their likely purpose
- Data types (dates, currencies, IDs)
- Potential data quality issues

Here are {num_examples} examples from previous uploads:
{few_shot_examples}

Analyze this spreadsheet:
[IMAGE: {screenshot}]
"""

analysis = claude_3.analyze(prompt, screenshot)

# 3. User provides labels
user_mappings = {
    "Product Code": "product_ean",
    "Amount": "sales_eur",
    "Date": "order_date"
}

# 4. Store as example for future
vector_db.store(
    vendor="acme",
    examples=user_mappings,
    file_structure=analysis
)

# 5. Next upload: AI uses stored examples
similar_examples = vector_db.search(
    query=new_file_structure,
    vendor="acme",
    top_k=5
)

ai_suggested_mapping = claude_3.suggest_mapping(
    new_file=new_screenshot,
    examples=similar_examples
)
```

**Cost**:
- Claude 3 Opus: ~$15 per 1M input tokens, ~$75 per 1M output tokens
- Typical file analysis: ~2,000 tokens = $0.03/file
- With caching: First file $0.03, subsequent files $0.005
- Vector DB: ~$50/month for 10,000 vendor examples

**Benefits**:
- ✅ True zero-code onboarding
- ✅ Learns from user corrections
- ✅ Handles completely new formats
- ✅ Natural language transformation rules
- ✅ State-of-the-art accuracy

**Challenges**:
- ⚠️ API cost at scale (mitigated by caching)
- ⚠️ Latency (2-5 seconds per analysis)
- ⚠️ Requires internet connectivity
- ⚠️ Black box (hard to debug AI decisions)

---

### Option 2: Hybrid ML + Rules Approach (Balanced)

**Components**:
1. **Column header classifier** (fine-tuned BERT model)
2. **Pattern extraction engine** (regex + ML)
3. **Active learning loop** (human-in-the-loop)
4. **Rule storage** (PostgreSQL with learned patterns)

**Flow**:
```python
# 1. Train column classifier on user examples
classifier = BERTColumnClassifier()
classifier.train(
    headers=["Product Code", "SKU", "EAN", "Item #"],
    label="product_ean"
)

# 2. User labels 10 rows
labeled_rows = user.label_rows(sample_rows, n=10)

# 3. Extract patterns
patterns = PatternExtractor().extract(labeled_rows)
# Example: "Amount" column always has "$" prefix → strip and convert

# 4. Apply to remaining rows
confident_rows = []
uncertain_rows = []

for row in remaining_rows:
    confidence = classifier.predict(row, patterns)
    if confidence > 0.90:
        confident_rows.append(transform(row, patterns))
    else:
        uncertain_rows.append(row)

# 5. Human reviews only uncertain rows
final_data = confident_rows + user.review(uncertain_rows)
```

**Cost**:
- One-time: Fine-tune BERT model (~$100, 2-3 days training)
- Ongoing: $0/file (runs locally)
- Infrastructure: +1 GPU instance ($200/month) or CPU-only (slower)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Zero per-file cost
- ✅ Fast (milliseconds per row)
- ✅ Runs offline
- ✅ Explainable (shows pattern rules)
- ✅ Active learning improves over time

**Challenges**:
- ⚠️ Requires ML expertise to set up
- ⚠️ Training data needed (bootstrap with GPT-4)
- ⚠️ Less flexible than LLM for novel formats
- ⚠️ Maintenance (model drift over time)

---

### Option 3: Hybrid LLM + Local Approach (Recommended)

**Best of Both Worlds**:
- Use **Vision LLM** for initial analysis and pattern detection
- Generate **deterministic rules** from AI analysis
- Store rules locally, execute without API calls
- Use AI only for new/uncertain cases

**Flow**:
```python
# First upload: Use AI
ai_analysis = gpt4_vision.analyze(file_screenshot)
rules = {
    "column_mappings": {...},
    "transformations": [
        {"type": "currency_convert", "from": "USD", "to": "EUR"},
        {"type": "date_parse", "format": "MM/DD/YYYY"}
    ],
    "validations": [...]
}

# Store as deterministic rules
db.save_vendor_rules(vendor="acme", rules=rules)

# Subsequent uploads: Use cached rules
if vendor_exists_in_cache("acme"):
    rules = db.get_vendor_rules("acme")
    result = execute_rules(file, rules)  # No API call!

    if result.confidence < 0.90:
        # Only call AI for uncertain cases
        ai_review = gpt4.review_uncertain_rows(result.uncertain)
else:
    # New vendor: Use AI
    rules = gpt4_vision.analyze(file_screenshot)
```

**Cost**:
- First file per vendor: $0.03 (AI analysis)
- Subsequent files: $0.00 (cached rules)
- Uncertain cases: $0.005 (partial AI review)
- **Average**: ~$0.01/file across all vendors

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Low cost (AI only for new vendors)
- ✅ Fast (cached rules execute locally)
- ✅ Explainable (see generated rules)
- ✅ Flexible (AI handles edge cases)
- ✅ Best accuracy (combines strengths)
