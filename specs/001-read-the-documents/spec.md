## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**Tenant Organization (e.g., Retail Company)**

A retail company sells products through multiple third-party resellers (distributors, online marketplaces, retail partners). Each reseller sends monthly sales reports in different formats (Excel, CSV) with inconsistent column names, currencies, and data structures. The company needs to:

1. Upload sales files from various resellers to a centralized platform
2. Have the system automatically detect the reseller format and clean/standardize the data
3. View consolidated sales analytics across all resellers
4. Ask questions about their sales data in plain English without writing SQL
5. Embed external analytics dashboards (Looker, Tableau, Power BI) for advanced visualization
6. Receive email notifications when uploads succeed or fail
7. Export reports in multiple formats (PDF, CSV, Excel)

**End User Personas within Tenant:**
- **Sales Analysts**: Track product performance, identify trends, create reports
- **Account Managers**: Monitor specific reseller partner sales activity
- **BI Teams**: Access clean, standardized data for corporate analytics
- **Management**: High-level sales performance overview for strategic decisions

**Platform Administrator (TaskifAI Admin)**

A platform administrator manages multiple independent customer organizations (tenants):

1. Provision new tenants with dedicated databases and subdomain access
2. Monitor platform-wide performance and resource usage
3. Suspend or reactivate tenant accounts as needed
4. Manage system-wide updates that automatically propagate to all tenants

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: File Upload & Processing
1. **Given** a user has sales data from reseller "Galilu" in Excel format, **When** they upload the file via the web interface, **Then** the system automatically detects it as Galilu format, processes it asynchronously, and notifies the user via email upon completion
2. **Given** a file contains 500 valid rows and 10 invalid rows, **When** processing completes, **Then** the system saves the 500 valid rows, generates an error report for the 10 failed rows, and displays both success and error counts

#### Scenario 2: AI-Powered Data Chat
1. **Given** a user has uploaded sales data, **When** they ask "What were my top 5 products last month?", **Then** the system generates and executes a SQL query, returns results in natural language, and maintains conversation context for follow-up questions
2. **Given** a user asks "Compare online vs offline sales", **When** the query is processed, **Then** the AI intelligently routes the query to both data sources and presents a combined analysis

#### Scenario 3: Multi-Tenant Isolation
1. **Given** Customer A and Customer B both use the platform, **When** Customer A uploads their sales data, **Then** Customer B cannot access, view, or query Customer A's data under any circumstances
2. **Given** a tenant accesses via subdomain customer1.taskifai.com, **When** they authenticate, **Then** all database operations are automatically scoped to their dedicated database

#### Scenario 4: Dashboard Management
1. **Given** a user has a Looker Studio dashboard, **When** they configure the dashboard URL and authentication, **Then** the dashboard is embedded in the platform and accessible via tabs
2. **Given** a user has multiple dashboards, **When** they designate one as primary, **Then** that dashboard loads by default on the dashboards page

#### Scenario 5: Tenant Provisioning
1. **Given** a platform admin wants to onboard a new customer, **When** they create a tenant via admin API with company name and subdomain, **Then** the system automatically provisions a dedicated database, applies schema, seeds configurations, and sends welcome email

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user uploads a file format the system doesn't recognize?
  - System should display a clear error message identifying that the vendor format is unknown and suggest manual configuration or support contact

- How does the system handle duplicate file uploads?
  - User should be warned if uploading a file with the same name/checksum and given options to append or replace existing data

- What happens if a tenant exceeds their database storage limit?
  - System should notify tenant admin via email and prevent new uploads until storage is increased or data is deleted

- How does AI chat handle ambiguous queries?
  - System should ask clarifying questions (e.g., "Did you mean online sales or offline sales?") rather than guessing

- What happens if external dashboard URL becomes invalid?
  - System should detect the error, display a user-friendly message in the iframe, and allow user to update the configuration

- How does the system handle tenant suspension?
  - When a tenant is suspended, all users of that tenant should be immediately logged out and prevented from accessing the system until reactivation
