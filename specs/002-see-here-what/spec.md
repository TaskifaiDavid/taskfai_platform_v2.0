**Feature Branch**: `002-see-here-what`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "see here what I wnt to implement: '/home/david/TaskifAI_platform_v2.0/multi_tenant.md'"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature description available in multi_tenant.md
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: multi-tenant architecture, tenant registry, central login portal, customer isolation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements clearly specified in source document
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows defined for admin and regular users
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and derived from source
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Tenants, Users, User-Tenant mappings identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed, implementation details filtered out
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
**Regular Customer Users**: A customer's team member visits the TaskifAI platform. They enter their email on the central login portal, and the system automatically identifies their organization and redirects them to their company's dedicated workspace where they complete authentication and access their data.

**Super Admin (David)**: The platform administrator can access multiple customer workspaces. When logging in, they see a list of all organizations they manage and can select which customer environment to access.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Regular User Single Tenant Login**
1. **Given** user belongs to exactly one organization, **When** they enter email on central portal, **Then** system automatically redirects to their organization's login page with email pre-filled
2. **Given** user completes authentication on organization subdomain, **When** login succeeds, **Then** they access only their organization's data workspace

**Scenario 2: Super Admin Multi-Tenant Access**
1. **Given** super admin has access to multiple organizations, **When** they enter email on central portal, **Then** system displays organization selector
2. **Given** super admin selects an organization, **When** selection confirmed, **Then** system redirects to selected organization's workspace

**Scenario 3: New Customer Onboarding**
1. **Given** new customer organization created, **When** customer admin first accesses system, **Then** they can login via their dedicated subdomain
2. **Given** customer admin authenticated, **When** they access dashboard, **Then** they see only their organization's data with no cross-customer visibility

**Scenario 4: Tenant Discovery**
1. **Given** user email registered in system, **When** they access central portal, **Then** system identifies their organization(s) within 2 seconds
2. **Given** user email not found, **When** they attempt login, **Then** system displays clear error message indicating no organization found

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user email exists in registry but organization is inactive? ‚Üí System blocks access and shows maintenance message
- How does system handle organization with no assigned database? ‚Üí System prevents login and alerts admin
- What if DNS not properly configured for new customer subdomain? ‚Üí System shows connection error with admin contact information
- How to handle user trying to access wrong organization subdomain directly? ‚Üí Redirect to central portal for tenant discovery

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Multi-Tenancy & Isolation**
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain complete data isolation between customer organizations using dedicated database per tenant
- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent cross-tenant data access for all user types except explicitly authorized super admins
- **FR-003**: Each customer organization MUST have unique subdomain identifier (e.g., customer1.taskifai.com)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support unlimited number of customer organizations with independent databases

**Tenant Registry & Discovery**
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain central registry of all customer organizations and their configurations
- **FR-006**: System MUST securely store encrypted database connection credentials for each tenant
- **FR-007**: System MUST map user emails to authorized organizations for tenant discovery
- **FR-008**: System MUST support users belonging to single organization (regular users)
- **FR-009**: System MUST support users belonging to multiple organizations (super admin only)

**Central Login Portal**
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide central login portal at primary domain (app.taskifai.com)
- **FR-011**: Portal MUST accept user email as initial input
- **FR-012**: Portal MUST query registry to discover user's organization(s)
- **FR-013**: Portal MUST automatically redirect single-org users to their subdomain

- **FR-015**: Portal MUST show clear error for unregistered email addresses

**Authentication Flow**
- **FR-016**: System MUST redirect users from central portal to organization-specific subdomain for credential entry
- **FR-017**: Organization subdomain MUST pre-fill user email from central portal handoff
- **FR-018**: System MUST validate credentials against organization's dedicated database

### Key Entities

**Tenant (Organization)**
- Represents customer organization using the platform
- Attributes: unique ID, company name, subdomain, database credentials (encrypted), active status, metadata
- One tenant = one dedicated database instance

**User-Tenant Mapping**
- Represents authorization of user to access specific organization
- Attributes: user email, tenant reference, role (member/admin/super_admin), creation timestamp
- Enforces which users can access which organizations

**Tenant Registry**
- Central database storing all organization configurations
- Contains: tenant records, user-tenant mappings, configuration settings, audit logs
- Single source of truth for tenant discovery and routing
