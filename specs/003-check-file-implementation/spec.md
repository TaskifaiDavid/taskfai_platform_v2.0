## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a platform user, I want to see a personalized dashboard that displays relevant sales metrics, recent activity, and top-performing products in a customizable layout, so I can quickly understand my business performance without navigating through multiple pages.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user logs into the platform for the first time, **When** they navigate to the dashboard, **Then** they see a default dashboard layout with key performance indicators, recent uploads, and top products

2. **Given** a user has a personalized dashboard configuration, **When** they load the dashboard, **Then** their custom layout is displayed instead of the tenant default

3. **Given** an administrator wants to customize the dashboard for a specific tenant, **When** they create a new dashboard configuration, **Then** all users in that tenant see the updated layout on their next login

4. **Given** a user wants to see different metrics, **When** an administrator modifies their dashboard configuration, **Then** the changes are reflected immediately upon page refresh

5. **Given** multiple users in the same tenant, **When** each user has their own custom dashboard, **Then** each user sees only their personalized layout without affecting others

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no default dashboard configuration exists for a tenant?
- How does the system handle invalid or corrupted dashboard configurations?
- What happens if a widget type is referenced but not available?
- How does the system prioritize between user-specific and tenant-wide defaults?
- What happens when a user's custom dashboard is deleted while they're viewing it?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Dashboard Display & Loading**
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a default dashboard to users who do not have a personalized configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST prioritize user-specific dashboard configurations over tenant-wide defaults
- **FR-003**: System MUST render dashboards within 5 seconds.
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle missing or unavailable widgets gracefully without breaking the entire dashboard

**Dashboard Configuration Management**
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow all users to create new dashboard configurations
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow all users to update existing dashboard configurations
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow all users to delete dashboard configurations
- **FR-008**: System MUST support both tenant-wide default dashboards and user-specific custom dashboards
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure only one default dashboard exists per user (user-specific) or per tenant (tenant-wide)

**Widget System**
- **FR-010**: System MUST support multiple widget types including KPI grids, recent activity displays, and top product rankings
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow widgets to be positioned in a grid layout with configurable row, column, width, and height
- **FR-012**: System MUST pass configuration properties to widgets for customization (e.g., item limits, display titles)
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate widget configurations to ensure required fields.

**Data Security & Isolation**
- **FR-014**: System MUST enforce tenant isolation so users can only view dashboard configurations for their tenant
- **FR-015**: System MUST enforce user isolation so users can only modify their own custom dashboards
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow tenant-wide default dashboards to be read by all users in that tenant
- **FR-017**: System MUST prevent regular users from modifying tenant-wide default configurations

**Dashboard Content**
- **FR-018**: System MUST support KPI metrics including total revenue, total units sold, average price, and total uploads
- **FR-019**: System MUST display recent upload activity with configurable item limits
- **FR-020**: System MUST display top-performing products with configurable ranking criteria and item limits
- **FR-021**: System MUST support dashboard-level filter configurations (date ranges, vendor filters, etc.)

**Customization & Flexibility**
- **FR-022**: System MUST store dashboard configurations in a format that allows new widget types to be added without database schema changes
- **FR-023**: System MUST support multiple dashboard configurations per user for switching between views.
- **FR-024**: System MUST allow dashboard metadata including name, description, active status, and display order

### Key Entities

- **Dashboard Configuration**: Represents a complete dashboard layout and settings
  - Attributes: unique identifier, name, description, active status, default flag, display order, creation/update timestamps
  - Relationships: Belongs to a user (for personal dashboards) or tenant (for shared defaults)
  - Contains: multiple widgets, KPI selections, filter settings

- **Widget**: A visual component that displays specific data or metrics
  - Attributes: unique identifier, type (KPI grid, recent uploads, top products, etc.), position in grid (row, column, width, height)
  - Configuration: custom properties passed to widget (title, item limits, sorting preferences)
  - Relationships: Part of a dashboard configuration

- **Layout**: The spatial arrangement of widgets on a dashboard
  - Attributes: grid-based positioning system with row/column coordinates, width/height spans
  - Constraints: widgets cannot overlap, must fit within dashboard boundaries

- **Filter Configuration**: Default filtering preferences for a dashboard
  - Attributes: date range settings, vendor selections, category filters, reseller filters
  - Scope: Applies to all widgets within a dashboard unless overridden at widget level

- **KPI Metric**: A measurable business indicator displayed on the dashboard
  - Types: total revenue, total units sold, average price, upload count, reseller count, category mix
  - Display: Typically shown as cards or tiles with current value and optional trend indicators

## Notes for Implementation Phase

This specification documents an **already implemented** system. The implementation summary shows:

- ‚úÖ Complete full-stack implementation with database, API, and UI components
- ‚úÖ Security through row-level access policies
- ‚úÖ Flexible widget system that can be extended
- ‚úÖ Default configurations seeded for immediate use
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing documentation

**Next Steps:**
1. Use `/clarify` to resolve the 4 marked clarifications before planning future enhancements
2. Use `/plan` to design Phase 2 features (additional widgets) or Phase 3 features (admin UI)
3. Consider creating separate feature specs for:
   - Admin dashboard builder UI
   - Additional widget types (reseller performance, category revenue, charts)
   - Dashboard sharing and templates
   - Real-time updates and WebSocket integration
