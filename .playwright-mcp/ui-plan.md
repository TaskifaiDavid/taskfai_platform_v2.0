#PLAN

1. research online what a good SaaS product has and its core components
2. research what works and what is likeable in a UI/UX - check reddit.com 
3. based on your research, use ui-ux-designer sub agent to design a impressive UI/UX
4. based on your research, use fronend-developer sub agent to build a beautiful frontend. 
5. Use playwright mcp to check your work, it should score a perfect score before ending. Loop the sequanece until it is perfect. 


do not use purple color
try not to look like all other generic AI built ui.
make sure its fully functional
functional is more important than flashy design.
