- Upgrade Supabase if needed: +$25/project
- Total: $40-90/month

**If budget is tight:**
- Migrate to VPS Droplets: $40-64/month
- Keep automated deployments via Docker
- Use deployment guides already created

---

### Phase 3: Optimize for Growth (Month 6+)

**High revenue scenario:**
- Stay on App Platform for simplicity
- Scale containers as needed
- Add CDN, load balancing
- Cost: $150-300/month

**Budget-conscious scenario:**
- Migrate to multi-droplet VPS: $64-135/month
- Keep App Platform for critical services
- Hybrid approach for best value

## üîç Real Cost Analysis

### App Platform "Extra" Cost is an Illusion

**Scenario: 3 tenants for 6 months**

| Metric | App Platform | VPS Droplets | Difference |
|--------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Infrastructure | $240 | $240 | $0 |
| Setup time value | $0 (30 min) | $240 (8 hours @ $30/hr) | -$240 |
| Monthly maintenance | $30 (30 min √ó 6) | $450 (15 hours √ó 6 @ $30/hr) | -$420 |
| Customer onboarding (2 customers) | $30 (1 hr @ $30/hr) | $300 (10 hours @ $30/hr) | -$270 |
| **TOTAL COST (6 months)** | **$300** | **$1,230** | **Save $930** |

**App Platform saves you $930 over 6 months** (in time value)

Even if you value your time at just $15/hour, you still save $465.

## üìà Growth Projection

### Customer Onboarding Capacity

**With App Platform + MCP:**
- Onboard 1 customer/week = 4 customers/month
- Time per customer: 30 min infrastructure + 3-5 days vendor processors
- Revenue potential: $2,000-5,000/month (4 customers @ $500-1,250 each)

**With VPS Droplets:**
- Onboard 1 customer/2 weeks = 2 customers/month
- Time per customer: 2-3 hours infrastructure + 3-5 days processors
- Revenue potential: $1,000-2,500/month (2 customers @ $500-1,250 each)

**App Platform enables 2x faster growth** = worth the "extra" $0-15/month

## üí∞ Break-Even Analysis

**When is VPS actually cheaper?**

If you value your time at $0/hour (or have unlimited free time):
- VPS is cheaper: $25-40/month vs $40/month App Platform

If you value your time at $15/hour or more:
- App Platform is cheaper: Saves $200+ in time per month

If you plan to onboard 3+ customers:
- App Platform is cheaper: Saves 6+ hours per customer = $180+

**Bottom line:** Unless you have unlimited free time or love DevOps, App Platform saves money.
